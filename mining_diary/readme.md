# Iran's Exchange and Gold Market

This project was mainly a personal project to practice my R skills in 2018. Still, after a severely turbulent period, I used it to publish some insight into [Iran's gold and dollar market](https://www.bbc.com/persian/business-41877123).

Since it was one of my first practice projects, the code was not very efficient, but it did the job. It tries to find an alternative date for missing values - by finding the previous available day for monthly, weekly and annual changes.

The provided dataset goes back to 2012 and includes daily prices. 

Note: Rial is Iran's official currency, but it's common to count with "Toman", which is **Rial / 10**, and all the results is in Toman.
